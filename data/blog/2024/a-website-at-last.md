Alright, so I finally got this thing set up! It's been years since I last had a website, and it's a bit
overdue, but anywaysâ€”here it is!

There's not very much to it yet, but the website is open source and
[available to view on GitHub](https://github.com/alsterholm/alsterholm.com) for those who are interested.

More things are in the pipeline, so keep an eye out!
