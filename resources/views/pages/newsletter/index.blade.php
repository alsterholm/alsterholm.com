                Hey â€” so you think you might be interested in what I have to say? That's awesome. I just have to tell you
                though, there is no actual newsletter. <em class="text-rose-700 dark:text-violet-300">Yet</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do however intend to start one eventually, to share cool stuff that I encounter and learn, and if you're
                interested to receive it once it gets rolling, feel free to submit your email down below.
